CURIOUS PROPERTIES OF 153
References about number 153 can be found in the New Testament, where in the net Simon Peter drew from the Sea of Tiberias held 153 fishes. Some of the interesting properties of number 153 published in [1] are:

Curious properties of number 153:

It is the smallest number which can be expressed as the sum of cubes of its digits:
153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3

It is equal to the sum of factorials of number from 1 to 5:
153 = 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5!

The sum of digits of 153 is a perfect square:
1 + 5 + 3 = 9 = 3**2

The sum of aliquot divisors of 153 is also a perfect square:
1 + 3 + 9 + 17 + 51 = 81 = 9**2

Aliquot divisors of a number are all the divisors of that number excluding the number itself but including 1. It is seen that the sum of aliquot divisors of 153 is the square of the sum of the digits of 153.

On adding the number 153 to its reverse, 504 is obtained, whose square is the smallest square which can be expressed as the product of two different non-square numbers which are reverse of one another:
153 + 351 = 504

504**2 = 288 x 882

It can be expressed as the sum of all integers from 1 to 17. In other words, 153 is the 17th triangular number. Since reverse of 153, i.e. 351 is also a triangular number, 153 can be termed as a reversible triangular number.
Number 153 is also a Harshad number(also called Niven number), i.e. it is divisible by the sum of its own digits:
153 / (1 + 5 + 3) = 17

Since reverse of 153, i.e. 351 is also a Harshad number(or Niven Number), 153 can be termed as a reversible Harshad number(or reversible Niven Number).

It can be expressed as the product of two numbers formed from its own digits:
153 = 3 * 51

Note that the digits used in multipliers are same as in product.

The number 135, which is formed by rearranging the digits of 153, can be expressed as:
135 = 11 + 32 + 53

The sum of all divisors of 153 is 234.
1 + 3 + 9 + 17 + 51 + 153 = 234

The product of aliquot divisors of 153 is 23409:

1 * 3 * 9 * 17 * 51 = 23409

Note that the product of aliquot divisors of 153 contain the sum of all divisors of 153 juxtaposed:

23409 = 234:09

234 = Sum of all divisors of 153

09 = Square root of the sum of aliquot divisors of 153.

When the cubes of the digits of any number, that is, a multiple of 3 are added, and then this process is repeated, the final result is 153, where the process ends because 153 = 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3
For example: Take the number 108

1**3 + 0**3 + 8**3 = 513 and 5**3 + 1**3 + 3**3 = 153

So, the number 108 reaches 153 in two cycles and it can be represented as

108→513→153

A detailed study of all numbers up to 105 reveals that all numbers which are multiple of 3 and are less than 105 reach 153 (after the repeated process of summing the cubes of digits is done) in maximum 14 cycles. However, maximum 13 cycles is required for all numbers, which are multiple of 3 and are less than 10,000.

The smallest number, which requires 13 cycles to reach 153, is 177, i.e.,

177→ 687→ 1071→345→ 216→ 225→ 141→ 66→ 432→ 99→ 1458→ 702→ 351→ 153

Table 1 indicates the smallest numbers, which reach 153 in cycles from 1 to 14.

It may be noted that the smallest number to reach 153 in 15 cycles will be more than 1019. Can you find it?

One of our books of sacred writings is titled The Hidden Words. It is a collection of short meditations, divided into two sections. The first section contains 71 items that were revealed in Arabic; the second section of 82 items was revealed in Persian (Farsi). I think you see my point already..... 71 + 82 = 153. I have often told my fellow believers about this connection between math and our Faith's literature. They are always quite impressed, to say the least.(Sent by Terry Trotter by email dt 25th Dec, 2001)

For any triangular number (Tn):
Tn * 1225 + 153 is a triangular number.
For example:
11225 + 153 = 1378 = T52
31225 + 153 = 3828 = T87
61225 + 153 = 7503 = T122
101225 + 153 = 12403 = T157

Note that 153 is a triangular number and 1225 is a traingular square number. (Sent by Richard Sewill by email dated 25 Feb 2015)
